          This service allows you to generate interactive, shareable plots of GWAS summary statistics. Building on years
          of experience from the developers of <a href="https://github.com/statgen/locuszoom">LocusZoom</a>, this adds
          new features such as Manhattan plots, annotation, and calculations to help summarize findings and put them
          in context. More annotation features are planned soon; subscribe to our
          <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/locuszoom">mailing list</a> to receive announcements.

                  When uploading, you can choose whether to make your dataset either public (viewable by anyone) or
                  private (viewable only to yourself). If you make your dataset public, other people will be able to
                  download the standardized summary statistic files that we generate during the upload process.
                  For all datasets, interactive plotting features require that we keep a copy of the data on our
                  servers.
                  We make every effort to keep this secure, but if privacy is a driving issue, consider using the
                  <a href="https://statgen.github.io/localzoom/">LocalZoom</a> tool to generate region plots
                  client-side instead. <em>LocalZoom</em> does not provide any enhanced annotation features, but it
                  works without uploading your data.

                <p>
                  You can delete your results from our servers at any time. The "delete this study" button may be found
                  by clicking the "edit" link at the top of the summary page
                  (only visible on studies that you uploaded).

                LocusZoom.js is dynamic and interactive: you can plot regions up to 500 kb wide at one time, but you can
                explore as many regions as you wish from a single upload. The server accepts uploads of up to 1 GB
                (this may change in the future). A manhattan plot and list of suggested regions will also be generated
                for you.

                The server attempts to handle many common GWAS formats, but we strongly recommend that you compress and
                tabix-index your results first. Your file should contain columns that identify key information, as
                described
                below. The data must a <strong>tab-delimited</strong> file and be <strong>sorted</strong> by chromosome
                and
                position. The upload step will ignore any columns whose meaning is not explicitly specified.
                The following columns are expected:
                <ul>
                  <li>Variant specification
                    <ul>

                      <li>By individual columns (preferred)
                        <ul>
                          <li>Chromosome</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>p-value or -log<sub>10</sub> p-value</li>
                  <li>(optional) Effect size (&beta;), assuming alt allele is the effect allele</li>
                  <li>(optional) Standard error of the effect size</li>
                  <li>
                    (optional) Allele frequency; will be oriented towards the alt allele
                    <ul>

                        to a
                        different allele (ref or alt) per row. The frequency must always refer to the same column for
                        all rows.

                Sometimes, it may be useful to share a GWAS with a collaborator, without having to make it public for
                everyone. This service allows you to generate private links that can be sent to trusted collaborators.
                These secret links allow view-only access to all summary and region plots. Sharing features can be
                accessed from the "share" link on top of the GWAS summary page.
