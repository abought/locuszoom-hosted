"""
Wrap individual data ingestion steps into something application-specific


0. Confirm that the file can be read (text or bgzipped format)
1. Validate that a GWAS file is valid and acceptable: has all columns; known chromosomes; pvals not missing or 0;
    data is sorted
    1a. - (optional) Validate build identifier (pheweb detect-ref) -
        TODO: this relies on a large data file that has to be built after install, which is not docker-friendly. We'll
          delay integrating this feature until improved.
    1b. Convert the GWAS file to normalized, tabixed, gzipped format
3. Generate data needed for binned manhattan plot + QQ plot.
4. (optional?) Find a list of top hits in each region, based on some algorithm/ criteria
